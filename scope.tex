\subsection{Scope}
\label{sect:scope}

This document describes the scope of activity to be executed at the \gls{USDF} 
by the awardee. \citeds{LDM-129} outlines the design era services foreseen for 
the data facility. This should be taken as informative rather than prescriptive.
\citeds{LDM-148} describes the full \gls{Data Management} Design and may be 
useful to understand the systems which will be deployed in the data facility.

\subsection{Motivation}
It is assumed this document will form part of the \gls{FOA} document package.
%We at least hope the contents are
%notes as we try to outline the scope of the data facility in detail here.

\subsection{Risk Factors}

Hardware pricing and how it is modeled over ten years is difficult to predict 
and assumptions on out year costs and replacement frequency vary between
institutions based on their experience and scale of operation. There is thus a 
significant risk of underestimating the cost of compute and storage.

Rubin Observatory staff are working with DOE and NSF to understand security concerns with the data path for Rubin between Cerro Pach\'{o}n in Chile and the \gls{USDF} as well as data content security concerns. At this point, no significant concerns (with potential significant associated cost) have been identified. The FOA will specify any security requirements placed on the \gls{USDF}.
