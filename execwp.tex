\subsection{\textbf{WP-03}: Rubin Execution}
\label{sect:wp03}
The Rubin execution team requires some level of support at the data facility.
The Execution team will run the pipelines which generate prompt and data release products for the community, as well as \gls{calibration}, environmental, quality and \gls{metadata} products for the data production and system performance departments.
There may be a need to run services to satisfy specific use cases as yet unidentified.
Execution staff at the \gls{USDF} will integrate reusable services, data layer, software, services provided by MoU, and \gls{ITC} to produce functioning 
services.
